# Smart-Assistant_Hey-Tom-
Here it is a virtual Assistant which can work as a google assistant/Siri/Alexa. Along with those features it has some additional features where we can initialize our own commands and run it according to our convenience and It has an ability to read  and make us listen to our own books or pdfs which are meanwhile in the device. It also has the ability to send WhatsApp messages with a scheduled time, we just need to give it the number(to the person we have to send) and the message and the time where the message should be sent. It automatically opens WhatsApp before 20seconds  to the scheduled time and gets ready to send the message and then sends it at the exact time. This assistant also has the ability to rotate the screen according to the commands of the user.
